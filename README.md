### Welcome, this project shows an electronic circuit that uses digital sensor that measures the distance
note: all files are uploaded and links to tinkercad projects is provided at the bottom.


### Here's a picture of the wiring on tinkercad

### The distance reading are shown on serial monitor.

In real life, we built a similar device, but we included an LED that would turn on if an object were to approach too close to it. In order to prevent the robotÂ from colliding with anything, the robot will halt at a specific distance when we implement it (instead of turning on the LED).

### Here's a video of the wiring in real life
